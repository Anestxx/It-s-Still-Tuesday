🌸 It’s Still Tuesday – Interactive Character Website
“It’s Still Tuesday” is a whimsical, interactive web experience featuring a reactive character brought to life with expressive animations, playful dialogue, and subtle environmental effects. Built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the project blends pixel charm with responsive interactivity.

✨ Key Features:

A stylized character that blinks, reacts, and talks with quirky game-like personality.

Eyes follow your cursor for a dynamic sense of presence.

Click interactions trigger expressions and randomized, animated dialogue.

Typewriter-style text paired with soft typing sounds for a nostalgic game feel.

🌸 Ambient falling flower petals add a calming, atmospheric touch.

Retro-style game UI fonts and layout.

This project is a fun blend of UI animation, light character scripting, and creative front-end design — ideal for learning event handling, DOM manipulation, and creating emotional interactions in the browser.
